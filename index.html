                        <p>I’m also a trainer with Google for the Digital Skills for Africa program. Basically, learning
                            at Moat Academy gave me an edge and boosted my confidence in the digital marketing space,
                            even though I didn’t pursue programming full
                            time. The knowledge I acquired has also enabled me to become independent as I run a digital
                            consulting company.
